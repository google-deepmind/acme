"""Objects which specify the input/output spaces of an environment.

This module exposes the same spec classes as `dm_env` as well as providing an
additional `EnvironmentSpec` class which collects all of the specs for a given
environment. An `EnvironmentSpec` instance can be created directly or by using
the `make_environment_spec` helper given a `dm_env.Environment` instance.
