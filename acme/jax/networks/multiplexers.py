  This takes as input a `critic_network`, an `observation_network`, and an
  `action_network` and returns another network whose outputs are given by
  `critic_network(observation_network(o), action_network(a))`.

  The observations and actions passed to this module are assumed to have a batch
  dimension that match.

  Notes:
  - Either the `observation_` or `action_network` can be `None`, in which case
    the observation or action, resp., are passed to the critic network as is.
  - If all `critic_`, `observation_` and `action_network` are `None`, this
    module reduces to a simple `tf2_utils.batch_concat()`.
