"""Logger for writing to an in-memory list.

This is convenient for e.g. interactive usage via Google Colab.

For example, for usage with pandas:

```python
from acme.utils import loggers
import pandas as pd

logger = InMemoryLogger()
# ...
logger.write({'foo': 1.337, 'bar': 420})

results = pd.DataFrame(logger.data)
```
"""

from typing import Sequence

from acme.utils.loggers import base


class InMemoryLogger(base.Logger):
    """A simple logger that keeps all data in memory."""

    def __init__(self):
        self._data = []

    def write(self, data: base.LoggingData):
        self._data.append(data)

    def close(self):
        pass

    @property
    def data(self) -> Sequence[base.LoggingData]:
        return self._data
