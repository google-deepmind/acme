  """Stacks a list of identically nested objects.

  This takes a sequence of identically nested objects and returns a single
  nested object whose ith leaf is a stacked numpy array of the corresponding
  ith leaf from each element of the sequence.

  For example, if `sequence` is:

  ```python
  [{
        'action': np.array([1.0]),
        'observation': (np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0]),),
        'reward': 1.0
   }, {
        'action': np.array([0.5]),
        'observation': (np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]),),
        'reward': 0.0
   }, {
        'action': np.array([0.3]),1
        'observation': (np.array([2.0, 3.0, 4.0]),),
        'reward': 0.5
   }]
  ```

  Then this function will return:

  ```python
  {
      'action': np.array([....])         # array shape = [3 x 1]
      'observation': (np.array([...]),)  # array shape = [3 x 3]
      'reward': np.array([...])          # array shape = [3]
  }
  ```

  Note that the 'observation' entry in the above example has two levels of
  nesting, i.e it is a tuple of arrays.

    sequence: a list of identically nested objects.

  Returns:
