# R2D2 - Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning

This folder contains an implementation of the R2D2 agent introduced in
([Kapturowski et al., 2019]). This work builds upon the DQN algorithm
([Mnih et al., 2013], [Mnih et al., 2015]) and Ape-X framework ([Horgan et al.,
2018]), extending distributed Q-Learning to use recurrent neural networks. This
version is a synchronous version of the agent, and is therefore not distributed.
