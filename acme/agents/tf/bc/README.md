# Behavioral Cloning (BC)

This folder contains an implementation for supervised learning of a policy from
a dataset of observations and target actions. This is an approach known as
Behavioral Cloning, introduced by [Pomerleau, 1989]. There is an example which
generates data for bsuite environment `Deep Sea` using an optimal policy.
