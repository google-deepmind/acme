    epsilon: for use by epsilon-greedy policies. If multiple, the epsilons are
      alternated randomly per-episode.
    seed: Random seed.
    learning_rate: Learning rate for Adam optimizer. Could be a number or a
      function defining a schedule.
    adam_eps: Epsilon for Adam optimizer.
    discount: Discount rate applied to value per timestep.
    target_update_period: Update target network every period.
    max_gradient_norm: For gradient clipping.
    max_abs_reward: Maximum absolute reward.
    huber_loss_parameter: The delta parameter of the huber loss.
    batch_size: Number of transitions per batch.
    prefetch_size: Prefetch size for reverb replay performance.
    num_sgd_steps_per_step: How many gradient updates to perform per learner
      step.
