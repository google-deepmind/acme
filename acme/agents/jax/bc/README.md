# Behavioral Cloning (BC)

This folder contains an implementation for supervised learning of a policy from
a dataset of observations and target actions.
This is an approach known as Behavioral Cloning, introduced by
[Pomerleau, 1989].
There is an example which generates data for bsuite environment `Deep Sea`
using an optimal policy.
