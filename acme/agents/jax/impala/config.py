        max_queue_size must be strictly larger than the batch size:
        - during the last step in an episode we might write 2 sequences to
          Reverb at once (that's how SequenceAdder works)
        - Reverb does insertion/sampling in multiple threads, so data is
          added asynchronously at unpredictable times. Therefore we need
          additional buffer size in order to avoid deadlocks."""
