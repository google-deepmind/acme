class PPOConfig:
    """Configuration options for PPO.

  Attributes:
    unroll_length: Length of sequences added to the replay buffer.
    num_minibatches: The number of minibatches to split an epoch into.
      i.e. minibatch size = batch_size * unroll_length / num_minibatches.
    num_epochs: How many times to loop over the set of minibatches.
    batch_size: Number of trajectory segments of length unroll_length to gather
      for use in a call to the learner's step function.
    replay_table_name: Replay table name.
    ppo_clipping_epsilon: PPO clipping epsilon.
    normalize_advantage: Whether to normalize the advantages in the batch.
    normalize_value: Whether the critic should predict normalized values.
    normalization_ema_tau: Float tau for the exponential moving average used to
      maintain statistics for normalizing advantages and values.
    clip_value: Whether to clip the values as described in "What Matters in
      On-Policy Reinforcement Learning?".
    value_clipping_epsilon: Epsilon for value clipping.
    max_abs_reward: If provided clips the rewards in the trajectory to have
      absolute value less than or equal to max_abs_reward.
    gae_lambda: Lambda parameter in Generalized Advantage Estimation.
    discount: Discount factor.
    learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the policy and critic networks.
    adam_epsilon: Adam epsilon parameter.
    entropy_cost: Weight of the entropy regularizer term in policy optimization.
    value_cost: Weight of the value loss term in optimization.
    max_gradient_norm: Threshold for clipping the gradient norm.
    variable_update_period: Determines how frequently actors pull the parameters
      from the learner.
    log_global_norm_metrics: Whether to log global norm of gradients and
      updates.
    metrics_logging_period: How often metrics should be aggregated to host and
      logged.
    pmap_axis_name: The name of the axis used for pmapping
    obs_normalization_fns_factory: The factory used for create observation
      normalization functions. Setting to None (default) disables observation
      normalization.
