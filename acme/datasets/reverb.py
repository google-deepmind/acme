  """Makes a TensorFlow dataset backed by a `Reverb` replay service.

  We need to explicitly specify up-front the shapes and dtypes of all the
  Tensors that will be drawn from the dataset. We require that the action and
  observation specs are given. The reward and discount specs use reasonable
  defaults if not given. We can also specify a boolean `transition_adder` which
  if true will specify the spec as transitions rather than timesteps (i.e. they
  have a trailing state). Additionally an `extra_spec` parameter can be given
  which specifies "extra data".

  Args:
    server_address: The Reverb server's address.
    environment_spec: The environment's spec.
    batch_size: Optional. If specified the dataset returned will combine
      consecutive elements into batches. This argument is also used to determine
      the cycle_length for `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` -- if unspecified the
      cycle length is set to `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE`.
    prefetch_size: How many batches to prefectch in the pipeline.
    sequence_length: Optional. If specified consecutive elements of each
      interleaved dataset will be combined into sequences.
    extra_spec: Optional. A possibly nested structure of specs for extras. Note
      that whether or not this is present changes the format of the data.
    transition_adder: Optional, defaults to False; whether the adder used with
      this dataset adds transitions.
    table: The name of the table to sample from replay (defaults to
      `adders.DEFAULT_PRIORITY_TABLE`).
    convert_zero_size_to_none: When True this will convert specs with shapes 0
      to None. This is useful for datasets that contain elements with different
      shapes for example `GraphsTuple` from the graph_net library. For example,
      `specs.Array((0, 5), tf.float32)` will correspond to a examples with shape
      `tf.TensorShape([None, 5])`.
    num_parallel_calls: Number of parallel threads creating ReplayDatasets to
      interleave.
    using_deprecated_adder: True if the adder used to generate the data is
      from acme/adders/reverb/deprecated.

  Returns:
    A tf.data.Dataset that streams data from the replay server.
