    """The Adder interface.

  An adder packs together data to send to the replay buffer, and potentially
  performs some reduction/transformation to this data in the process.

  All adders will use this API. Below is an illustrative example of how they
  are intended to be used in a typical RL run-loop. We assume that the
  environment conforms to the dm_env environment API.

  ```python
  # Reset the environment and add the first observation.
  timestep = env.reset()
  adder.add_first(timestep.observation)

  while not timestep.last():
    # Generate an action from the policy and step the environment.
    action = my_policy(timestep)
    timestep = env.step(action)

    # Add the action and the resulting timestep.
    adder.add(action, next_timestep=timestep)
  ```

  Note that for all adders, the `add()` method expects an action taken and the
  *resulting* timestep observed after taking this action. Note that this
  timestep is named `next_timestep` precisely to emphasize this point.
