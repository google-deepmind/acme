  """Helper used to calculate the priority of a sequence of steps.

  This converts the sequence of steps into a PriorityFnInput tuple where the
  components of each step (actions, observations, etc.) are stacked along the
  time dimension.

  Priorities are calculated for the sequence or transition that starts from
  step[0].next_observation. As a result, the stack of observations comes from
  steps[0:] whereas all other components (e.g. actions, rewards, discounts,
  extras) corresponds to steps[1:].

  Note: this means that all components other than the observation will be
  ignored from step[0]. This also means that step[0] is allowed to correspond to
  an "initial step" in which case the action, reward, discount, and extras are
  each None, which is handled properly by this function.

  Args:
    priority_fns: a mapping from table names to priority functions (i.e. a
      callable of type PriorityFn). The given function will be used to generate
      the priority (a float) for the given table.
    steps: a list of Step objects used to compute the priorities.

  Returns:
    A dictionary mapping from table names to the priority (a float) for the
    given collection of steps.
